## Training Materials

These materials will help the user with applying the operationalizing ontology patterns across varying levels of technical and academic acuity.

* __Beginners__ users have some domain expertise, but have little to no ontology application experience and may have less technical skills or exposure to ontology tools and architectures.
* __Intermediate__ users have a good amount of ontology application experience and can work with other on domain expertise (including their own) with some tools and architectures, but are not engineering new solutions.
* __Advanced__ users have a strong grasp of ontology tools and architectures, able to build new solutions for users at the intermediate and beginner levels.
